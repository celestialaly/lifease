# Lifease

While struggling to do daily chores with my partner, I was brainstorming on how to improve our daily life.
As a developer, I immediately considered developing a tool to help with that

## Main goal

- Create a tool that simplifies daily chores at home (trying to get a tool that helps getting things done when you have ADHD)

## Developer goal

- Improve my Kotlin/Spring Boot/TDD/DDD experience & keep learning/experimenting things
- Learn Nuxt & improve my VueJS experience
- Set up the app on our local network with a Raspberry Pi
- Learn, learn, learn.

## MVP Features objectives

- Have tasks assigned to room with priority order
- If possible, retrieve agenda events & tasks to display them

## Midterm objectives

- Add deadline to tasks
- Assign tasks to a specific family member
- Send notifications to a third-service (discord, phone)
- Add more features like connected lights management
- Many things I probably don't think of and need to brainstorm

# Long term objectives

- Add some gamification ?
